Certainly! I'll add your Sales Prediction project to the README file and integrate it seamlessly with the existing content. Here's an updated version of the README that includes your new project:

# CodSoft ðŸ’»

This repository contains four data science projects implemented using Python and Streamlit. Each project demonstrates different aspects of machine learning and data analysis.

## Projects

1. Iris Data Classification
2. Movie Review Prediction
3. Credit Card Fraud Detection
4. Sales Prediction

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Plotly
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Git-me-Harish/CodSoft.git
   cd data-science-projects
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Descriptions and Usage

### 1. Iris Data Classification

This project classifies Iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

To run the Iris Data Classification app:
```
streamlit run iris_classification.py
```

Features:
- Data visualization of Iris dataset
- Training of multiple classification models
- Interactive prediction of Iris species

### 2. Movie Review Prediction

This project predicts movie ratings based on various features such as year, duration, and genre.

To run the Movie Review Prediction app:
```
streamlit run movie_prediction.py
```

Features:
- Data preprocessing and visualization of movie dataset
- Training of regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Interactive prediction of movie ratings

### 3. Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.

To run the Credit Card Fraud Detection app:
```
streamlit run fraud_detection.py
```

Features:
- Handling imbalanced dataset
- Training of classification models for fraud detection
- Interactive prediction of transaction legitimacy

### 4. Sales Prediction

This project predicts sales based on advertising spend across different channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper).

To run the Sales Prediction app:
```
streamlit run sales_prediction.py
```

Features:
- Interactive data exploration with visualizations
- Polynomial regression model for sales prediction
- Feature importance analysis
- Real-time sales predictions based on user input

## Data

Each project requires its respective dataset:
- Iris Data Classification: `IRIS.csv`
- Movie Review Prediction: `IMDb Movies India.csv`
- Credit Card Fraud Detection: `creditcard_data.csv`
- Sales Prediction: `advertising.csv`

Ensure these files are present in the same directory as their corresponding Python scripts.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the projects are welcome. Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`)
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
